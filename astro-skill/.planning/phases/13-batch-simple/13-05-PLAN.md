<objective>
Apply XML semantic containers to project-structure.md (6 ## sections, 10 ### subsections staying flat inside parents). Most structurally complex file in the batch.

Purpose: Fifth and final file in the batch, validates flat structure with ### subsections inside parent tags.
Output: project-structure.md with 6 XML tags wrapping all ## sections, committed after validation.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Record baseline and apply 6 XML tags to project-structure.md</name>
  <files>.claude/skills/astro-cloudflare/references/project-structure.md</files>
  <action>
1. Record baseline: `wc -c .claude/skills/astro-cloudflare/references/project-structure.md`

2. Add XML container tags around each ## section. Tag map (6 tags, FLAT):

| Line | Header | Tag | Note |
|------|--------|-----|------|
| 5 | `## Quick Reference` | `<quick_reference>` | Universal |
| 16 | `## File Organization` | `<file_organization>` | Contains 2 ### subsections (untagged) |
| 72 | `## Naming Conventions` | `<naming_conventions>` | Direct derivation |
| 92 | `## Config Templates` | `<config_templates>` | Contains 8 ### subsections (untagged) |
| 223 | `## Anti-patterns` | `<anti_patterns>` | Universal |
| 238 | `## Troubleshooting` | `<troubleshooting>` | Universal |

IMPORTANT:
- Line 3 has a subtitle ("Astro 5.x on Cloudflare: file organization, naming conventions, and config templates."). It stays OUTSIDE all tags, same as the file title.
- `<quick_reference>` opens at the `## Quick Reference` line, NOT at the subtitle line.
- All ### subsections stay INSIDE their parent tags WITHOUT their own XML tags (flat structure per pilot precedent).
- The 5 ### subsections with SKILL.md grep patterns (astro.config SSG, astro.config SSR, tsconfig.json, src/env.d.ts, src/content.config.ts) remain queryable because grep targets the ### header text, which is preserved unchanged.

Rules (from XML-CONVENTIONS.md):
- Opening tag goes immediately BEFORE the `##` header (no blank line between tag and header)
- Closing tag goes immediately AFTER the last content line of the section (no blank line before closing tag)
- Blank lines BETWEEN sections are preserved
- File title and subtitle stay outside all tags
- NO nesting -- flat structure only
- DO NOT modify any content -- only add XML tag lines

3. Validate all 4 checks:

Check 1 -- Grep patterns (9 patterns including ### subsections, all must return exactly 1 match):
```bash
cd .claude/skills/astro-cloudflare
grep -n "## File Organization" references/project-structure.md | wc -l              # expect 1
grep -n "## Naming Conventions" references/project-structure.md | wc -l             # expect 1
grep -n "### astro.config.mjs -- SSG" references/project-structure.md | wc -l       # expect 1
grep -n "### astro.config.mjs -- SSR" references/project-structure.md | wc -l       # expect 1
grep -n "### tsconfig.json" references/project-structure.md | wc -l                 # expect 1
grep -n "### src/env.d.ts" references/project-structure.md | wc -l                  # expect 1
grep -n "### src/content.config.ts" references/project-structure.md | wc -l         # expect 1
grep -n "## Anti-patterns" references/project-structure.md | wc -l                  # expect 1
grep -n "## Troubleshooting" references/project-structure.md | wc -l                # expect 1
```

Check 2 -- Diff integrity:
```bash
git diff .claude/skills/astro-cloudflare/references/project-structure.md | grep '^+' | grep -v '^+++' | grep -v '^+$' | grep -v '^+</?[a-z_]*>$'
# Must return empty
```

Check 3 -- Overhead:
```bash
wc -c .claude/skills/astro-cloudflare/references/project-structure.md
# Calculate: (after - before) / before * 100, must be < 5%
```

Check 4 -- Tag balance:
```bash
grep -c '^<[a-z_]*>$' .claude/skills/astro-cloudflare/references/project-structure.md   # expect 6
grep -c '^</[a-z_]*>$' .claude/skills/astro-cloudflare/references/project-structure.md  # expect 6
```

4. If all checks pass, commit:
```bash
git add .claude/skills/astro-cloudflare/references/project-structure.md
git commit -m "feat(13-05): apply XML semantic containers to project-structure.md"
```
  </action>
  <verify>All 4 validation checks pass (grep patterns including ### subsections, diff integrity, overhead < 5%, tag balance 6/6). Commit created.</verify>
  <done>project-structure.md has 6 XML containers with flat structure (### subsections untagged inside parents), zero content changes, overhead < 5%, all 9 grep patterns return 1 match, committed.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `grep -c '^<[a-z_]*>$' .claude/skills/astro-cloudflare/references/project-structure.md` returns 6
2. `grep -c '^</[a-z_]*>$' .claude/skills/astro-cloudflare/references/project-structure.md` returns 6
3. All 9 SKILL.md grep patterns for project-structure.md return exactly 1 match each (including 5 ### patterns)
4. `git diff HEAD~1 -- .claude/skills/astro-cloudflare/references/project-structure.md | grep '^+' | grep -v '^+++' | grep -v '^+$' | grep -v '^+</?[a-z_]*>$'` returns empty
5. Overhead < 5%
</verification>

<success_criteria>
project-structure.md contains 6 XML semantic containers wrapping every ## section with flat structure (no nesting), with zero content modifications and all 9 SKILL.md grep patterns (including ### subsections) returning exactly 1 match.
</success_criteria>
